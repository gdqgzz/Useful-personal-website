                          A rim is the circular part of a wheel that holds the tire, and is attached to the hub by a series of spokes. Most modern rims are constructed out of alloy or carbon fiber. While alloy rims tend to be more flexible and are cheaper to manufacture, carbon fiber rims are hand made, lighter than their alloy counterparts, and are often stiffer and stronger. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          At Light Bicycle, we make high-performance rims and other cycling parts from Japanese Toray carbon fiber.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>1. Center channel / rim bed / drop channel</b></p>
                        <p>
                          We use the latest generation of machinery to achieve
                          the most stable temperature and air pressure
                          throughout the heating, curing, and cooling process.
                          With careful control of all aspects during the ~45
                          minute cycle, we can make rims with a flawless finish.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>2. Rim hooks</b></p>
                        <p>
                          Rim hooks are inward-facing ridges formed around the outer circumference of a rim and offer greater stability and tire retention, especially at high tire pressures. Hooked rims help to keep traditional clincher tires from blowing off at high pressure. Rims with hooks are called hooked rims and those without are referred to as hookless.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>3. Bead locks</b></p>
                        <p>
                          Bead locks are small ridges set on either side of the center channel. These locks make tires easier to mount and reduce the risk of burping and tire blow-off, especially at lower pressures. Bead locks make all of our clincher rims tubeless-ready.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>4. Rim offset</b></p>
                        <p>
                         A rim with offset at the spoke access holes on the rim bed is referred to as asymmetric. We employ asymmetric profiles on some MTB rims so that spoke tension between each side of the wheel is closer to being equal. An evenly tensioned wheel will stay in true longer and perform better over time. How to choose between symmetric and asymmetric rims >>
                        </p>
                        <p><b>5. Angled holes</b></p>
                        <p>
                         Nipple holes are drilled through the rim at an angle (+/-6° typically) which works well with average hub dimensions. This allows nipples to create tension straight in line with the spokes, rather than at an angle. Keeping the nipple and spoke in line results in fewer broken spokes and less need for wheel service.

                         When it comes to bike tires, you can choose between tubular, clincher, and tubeless options. Clincher tires are the most popular and traditional, while tubeless are a modern variant of the clincher where a tire is seated using tire sealant rather than a conventional rubber tube. A tubular tire, with a one-piece tube built in, differs greatly from the other two in shape and performance. While each option has its own pros and cons, we’re happy to offer a wide range of carbon rims to fit different tire types and intended uses.

                        <p>Besides one MTB offering (RM29T01), all of our tubular rims are made for Road Disc and Non-Disc uses. Use the sidebar filters on our product page to assist in narrowing down options by using the category “Type”. We label the tubular models with the letter T (for Tubular), such as R45T, R35T disc, and RM29T01.</p>

                          All our clincher rims come tubeless-ready (with holes at the rim bed by default). Rims over 25mm in depth can be produced without spoke access holes to go fully tubeless without the need for rim tape.

                        Disc brake and rim brake differ in the locations where braking force is applied. Disc brakes apply force to the rotor via calipers while rim brakes apply the force directly to the edge of the rim itself.

                        Upgrades are available from the high TG surface of our non-disc rims to a grooved graphene brake track for better braking performance. The improved surface helps evacuate trapped moisture between the pad and the rim in wet conditions, and increases friction when conditions are dry so less force is required at the braking lever.

                      The best way to calculate spoke length is the measure the
                      ERD on the rims in person, and use a calculation method
                      that you are familiar with. If you choose to use an online
                      calculator and order spokes in advance, there is some risk
                      that the lengths could be incorrect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Our ERD measurement is measured from the nipple bed on one
                      side of the rim to the nipple bed on the other.

                      Nipples with standard heads - Most online calculators can
                      use our standard ERD dimension to get an accurate spoke
                      length. Round up to the nearest mm when the calculator
                      gives you the spoke length.

                    <p>
                      Internal Nipples - Typically you would add 8mm to the ERD
                      listed on our website.

                      Nipples with raised heads (Hex, Squorx, Double Square
                      etc.) - Add 2mm to our ERD dimension. Round up to the
                      nearest mm when the calculator gives you the spoke length.

                      Asymmetrical rims are designed and drilled to compensate
                      for the offset design of most hubs. The asymmetry of the
                      rim allows the spokes to equalize in tension between the
                      drive and non-drive sides of the wheel. The result is in
                      more even spoke lengths and a stronger wheel build which
                      requires less truing than a traditional rim.

                      Symmetrical rims utilize standard drilling practices and
                      do not compensate for the offset hub design.

                      Asymmetric rims have become increasingly popular in recent
                      years, and for good reason. By shifting the nipple bed
                      over slightly, an asymmetric rim creates a stronger,
                      stiffer, and more reliable wheel building when compared to
                      a standard rim. In the following video, we walk through
                      why asymmetric rims are advantageous and explain how they
                      should be oriented when you are building your wheelset.

                      The weave patterns you see on some of our rims are only
                      the external layer and are done for cosmetic reasons. This
                      layer utilizes the same resin system as the rest of the
                      rim and so the weight and performance are not
                      significantly changed. UD is the most popular option.

                      32h rims are produced in a larger quantity and have the
                      lowest average weight (fewer holes). So although there is
                      some overall weight savings from a reduced spoke count due
                      to the spoke/nipple savings, the overall wheel weight is
                      surprisingly similar. For most riders, we recommend 32h
                      because the wheel builds have more strength and the forces
                      are spread out between more spokes.

                    <p class="mt-3">
                      Some really light riders want less wheel stiffness, so a
                      lower spoke count and smaller gauge of spoke can be used.
                      Choosing 28h strictly to save weight is not necessary.

                      Alloy nipples save about 40 grams per wheelset (rotational
                      weight) and come in a variety of nice colors so they are
                      the most popular choice. Traditionally, brass nipples had
                      a more outright strength and handled corrosion better than
                      alloy nipples.

                      We like to use the double square version of their Secure
                      Lock nipples which have several advantages over other
                      nipples. Besides the enhanced corrosion protection, they
                      provide full thread engagement due to the enlarged head,
                      have significantly higher shear strength, the 7075 series
                      alloy is harder than competitors alloy nipples, feature a
                      special treatment to reduce friction when building wheels,
                      the secure lock function prevents nipples loosening
                      prematurely, and the angle at the base of the heads is
                      tapered more so that they pull more in line with the
                      spokes.

                      Picking the correct rim depth should be as much about
                      choosing one that is comfortable and confidence-inspiring
                      than it is about choosing one that is just as fast as
                      possible. The deeper is not necessarily the better - it
                      depends on the terrain you’re riding, your weight, rider’s
                      cycling skill, and riding event types you will compete in.
                      As the depth increases, the stability, stiffness, and aero
                      gains of rims vary.

                      Here is our general recommendation on the tire width range
                      that works best with a given internal rim width.
                    </p>
                    <p class="px-lg-0">
                      This is an estimation of rim width tyre size chart to help
                      identify what rims you should look at, however tire brands
                      will have their own recommendations which should be
                      adhered to. This information can be found on the sidewall
                      of your tires.
                    </p>
                    <p class="px-lg-0">
                      Generally speaking, if your tire is narrow compared to the
                      rim, you risk pinch flatting and damage to the wide rim.
                      If your tire is too wide compared to the rim, you risk
                      burping/excess tire roll, and poor stability.

                            compatibility tests with some of the most popular

                            bead design, inflation pressures, and other
                            variables will affect the actual rim-tire
                            compatibility. The chart data should be verified

                            with a range from 4.3” to 5.0”, 4.7” is an optimal
                            option for most riders.

                      What size road tires to use? We’ve just measured the
                      actual width of various road tires on our R/AR/WR-rims.
                      The tire size we pick ranges from 23C to 32C (Vittoria,
                      Maxxis, Continental, and other big brands). Also, we rank
                      the ease of tire mounting from 1 (the easiest) to 10 (the
                      hardest) with some installation tips. All the measurements
                      are done when the tire is inflated to 60psi. View the data

                      An asymmetric rim has the rim bed and spoke access holes
                      offset from the centerline. This helps even the spoke
                      tension between the drive and the non-drive side,
                      meanwhile, allowing for more equal spoke angles and
                      lengths in the build. As a result, asymmetric wheel builds
                      are often stronger, stiffer, and more reliable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Please note that when using an offset frameset like
                      Cannondale Ai, you can only use symmetric rims for the
                      bike build.

                      Find the longer and shorter arcs first. It is easy to do
                      so in two ways: by looking at the valve hole in relation
                      to the spoke access holes; or by looking at the product
                      serial number label (the arc closer to the barcode is the
                      shorter, and the other side closer to the numbers is the
                      longer).

                      Spoke hole is drilled on an angle according the hub
                      flange. This allows the nipple to pull straight in line
                      with the spoke for reduced stress. The result? Fewer
                      broken spokes and nipples.

                      All of our MTB rims utilize a hookless design, and this
                      bead type has become an option for the road market. On a
                      hookless rim the carbon fiber is allowed to flow
                      continuously over the bead area to improve impact
                      resistance. Without the hook, we were also able to thicken
                      the rim wall, making it even stronger. Finally, using a
                      hookless rim simplifies the manufacturing process and
                      leads to a more consistent carbon compaction - a technical
                      way to say this leads to a stronger rim.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hookless rim walls are both smoother and straighter than
                      hooked beads. This means that the tire will touch rim
                      walls fully and mounted perfectly, allowing you to run
                      lower tire pressure without risk of air loss or pinch
                      flats.

                      The hookless version is designed with low pressure impact
                      resistance in mind and the maximum recommended tire
                      pressure for our hookless rims is 70psi for road type and

                      Both our R series and CX series feature a U-shape profile
                      spreads the force of impacts and creates a more robust
                      product. The U-Shaped profile also decreases lateral wind
                      resistance and is both more stable and faster in a
                      crosswind than a traditional V-Shaped wheel.

                      R-Series: With a 17.9mm internal width and 25mm external
                      width, our R-series wheels (U25, U35, U45, U55, and U65)
                      are the most aerodynamic and fastest rolling with a 25mm
                      or 28mm tire.

                    <p>
                      The wider CX (CX36 and CX46) series rims have a 21mm
                      internal width and 28mm external width perform optimally
                      with a 33-42mm tire. Wider rims help provide more
                      stability, excellent handling and, at the same time, a
                      more comfortable ride. They are ideal for disc brake
                      equipped road, cyclocross, and gravel bikes and are
                      available in both rim brake version and road disc version,
                      and in a hook and hookless design.

                      Both the R-series and the CX-series feature a U-shaped
                      profile that offers a number of benefits when compared to
                      a more traditional V-shaped rim profile when it comes to
                      aerodynamics, stability, and strength. While a V-shaped
                      profile and U-shaped profile of the same depth offer
                      roughly the same aerodynamic resistance in straight
                      headwind, the U-shaped profile reduces the lateral
                      resistance in non-direct winds. In the real world this
                      means that the U-Shaped profiles are both more aerodynamic
                      and stable in crosswinds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Similarly, a U-shaped profile allows for the usage of a
                      wider tire without an aerodynamic penalty. Our R-Series
                      and CX-Series have a 25mm and 28mm outer width
                      respectively. This means that the profiles are
                      aerodynamically optimized for up to 25c (R-Series) and 28c
                      (CX series) tires. Our U-Shape rims also feature
                      non-parallel brake tracks which improve airflow over the
                      tire, eliminate the need to toe in your brake pads, and
                      help dissipate heat build up on the edge of the rim.
                      U-Shaped rims are also stronger than traditional V-Shaped
                      profiles because the U-shape spreads the force of impacts
                      more evenly across the entire rim.

                      All of our R-Series and CX-series rims are also tubeless

                      A variable thickness nipple bed reinforces key areas

                      or stiffness of the rim.

                    <p>
                      If it isn’t clear from the name, the Flyweights are the
                      lightest rims available from Light Bicycle and, for that
                      matter, some the very lightest available on the market.
                      Despite what you might think, the Flyweight does not refer
                      to a particular rim, but rather a construction process.
                      We’ll talk a lot of exactly what this process is later in
                      this blog, but the short version is that Flyweight rims
                      are built to be as light as possible by using a blend of
                      Toray T700 and T-800 carbon, a new prepreg, and a new
                      layup. The result is that each rim built using the
                      Flyweight construction process drops anywhere from 100-80g
                      compared to the same mould using our standard rim
                      construction. So far Light Bicycle has launched the
                      RM29C06 29” XC rims (280g), the RM6100BC09 27.5” XC rims
                      (260g), and the RG922 700c Gravel rims (380g), ect are
                      using Flyweight construction, but as we continue to
                      develop the process and update our lineup, more and more
                      rims will become available with Flyweight Construction.

                    <p class="mt-5"><i>New Construction Process</i></p>
                    <p>
                      We modified three main processes in our construction to
                      make the Flyweight rims as light as they are: 1) We used a
                      blend of Toray T800 and T-700, 2) We used a lower FAW
                      (fiber areal weight) and new preg and, 3) We used a new
                      layup design at the nipple bed to reduce the amount of
                      material needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As we were saying, the flyweights rims are built using a
                      mix of Toray T800 and Toray T-700 carbon fiber. What does
                      this mean? Most of the rims that we build and, for that
                      matter, that anyone else builds use exclusively Toray
                      T700. The reason for that is quite simple; T700 is a
                      little heavier, but far more robust than a Toray T800 rim.
                      A rim Toray T800 is would be far too stiff, because of
                      that, be quite brittle and crack easily. However, for the
                      past number of year we have been experimenting with using
                      a blend of Toray T700 and T800 to build a super
                      lightweight rim that is still tough enough to race on. The
                      result of this is the Flyweight construction process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One of the keys to the Flyweight process and what is
                      largely responsible to allowing us to use Toray T700 and
                      T800 in the same rim is our new Prepreg. The new Prepreg
                      has a much lower Fiber Areal Weight and we can create a
                      more adjustable layup. This means that the stress between
                      layers is reduced and the T800 can be used without
                      creating the stiffness problem that typically comes with
                      building a Toray T800 rim.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Another feature of the Flyweight construction process is a
                      new nipple bed layup. On the flyweights we build up the
                      layers differently depending on what the spoke hole
                      drilling is going to be. The layup takes quite a bit
                      longer to perform than our standard layup, but results in
                      those no compromise marginal weight gains that we wanted
                      out of a race wheelset.
                    </p>
                    <p><i>Strength and Testing</i></p>
                    <p>
                      You’re probably wondering, are these super light XC rims
                      strong and stiff enough? The short answer? Yes. Although
                      they are intended as a race wheelset, one of the main
                      priorities with the Flyweights was to make a race oriented
                      rim that could handle whatever even the most technical XC
                      tracks through its way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Not only did we use lab testing to make sure that this was
                      the case, but we also sent some of the first Flyweight
                      rims to riders that are more likely to be found racing
                      Enduros than they are to be found on a Cross Country
                      course and told them to ride them the same way they’d ride
                      their Enduro wheels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We even had one of our 175lbs test riders drop the
                      pressure far below what we would recommend and rip down a
                      double black diamond trail just to check the Flyweights
                      impact resistance. Despite bottoming out the rims on rocks
                      numerous times, he didn’t break it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Obviously that kind of riding isn’t recommended for these,
                      or any, rims, but we wanted to see what type of real world
                      forces our Flyweight XC rim could handle. The answer? A
                      whole lot more than you’ll find on a cross country trails.

                      each rim. We've achieved this lighter weight by using a

                      Both our R-Series (25mm) and CX-series (28mm) rims feature
                      a wide profile that allows for wider tires without an
                      aerodynamic penalty. When the rim width is more close to
                      the tire's width. This airflow tends to be smoother than
                      the lightbulb shape of a wide tire-narrow rim.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So why a wider tire is better? Wider road tires reduce the
                      risk of pinch flatting at a given tire pressure and reduce
                      rolling resistance. You can also run lower air pressure
                      which absorbs more road shock, and improve the traction
                      and stability. Wider tires tend to have better grip on web
                      or irregular road surface. In the past, road racers used
                      21mm tires at 1100 psi (10 bar) for everyday usage.
                      However, more recently we have seen nearly a universal
                      adoption of 23 and 25mm tires by the Professional Peloton
                      at pressures from 90 to 115 pounds. It is even becoming
                      popular to use 28mm tires and even lower pressure for
                      particularly rough courses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Second, the wide rims improve handling or cornering by
                      creating a larger contact patch. If you were to image that
                      you have a set of 25mm tires and mount them on both a 23mm
                      and 25mm rim, the contact patch on the narrower rim will
                      be more narrow. The wider rim, however, has both a wider
                      contact patch and increases air volume slightly, and makes
                      the tires sidewalls more vertical. This means that the
                      tire casing has to deflect less to make the same size
                      contact patch.

                      The rim or parts are carefully inspected and weighed with
                      a gram scale. The weight needs to be within a close
                      tolerance if it is to pass and move on to the next
                      process. The weight and worker ID# is recorded on a
                      computer for permanent record keeping.

                      Each rim requires between 30-40 layers of carbon fiber
                      prepreg. Our most experienced workers apply the prepreg by
                      hand and the process takes 30-45 minutes for most rims.

                      <b>Standard version:</b>Constructed with premium Toray
                      T700 carbon fiber. The good strength to weight ratio with
                      no expense spared.

                    <p>
                      <b>Flyweight version: </b>Flyweight is a technology we
                      developed to manufacture the lightest rims in our lineup.
                      Keep an eye out as we’re expanding this technology to
                      other products as we grow. Targeted specifically towards
                      racers who seek every possible edge on the race course.
                      Hybrid construction of Toray T800 and T700 was used to
                      reduce wall thickness in key areas while enhancing the
                      overall rim stiffness. These rims are available with the
                      UD material only due to the strict standards required to
                      produce the Flyweight model. We used a lower FAW (fiber
                      areal weight) and a thinner prepreg to achieve a more
                      adjustable layup schedule design which reduces the stress
                      between the layers of carbon fiber.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-3"><b>(2).Precise Layup</b></p>
                    <p>
                      Carbon fiber layup orientation is one of the most
                      important steps to make rims strong but keep them
                      lightweight. Each rim of LB carries its own unique layup
                      schedule documents which are followed meticulously by the
                      layup workers.

                    <p>
                      While many companies manufacture with a 3-layer wrap which
                      accelerates production, we have larger equipment that
                      allows for a one-piece continuous layer. This
                      uninterrupted layer not only produces a stronger rim, but
                      a lighter one!

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Some manufacturers use a pre-cured carbon ring at the
                      nipple bed to accelerate production and create a smooth
                      nipple bed appearance. The drawback is that it essentially
                      goes through the curing process twice so it’s not as
                      stable or as durable. Some go so far as to significantly
                      increase its thickness so the strength is improved, but
                      that’s just needless weight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At LB, we build up this area layer by layer which results
                      in much better spoke tension tests results and a lower
                      system weight.

                    <p>
                      In the past due to the type/thickness of the air bladder,
                      a square hole was used in the removal process. This square
                      notch was a weak point even after a carbon patch was
                      installed and main rim structure was not as strong as it
                      could be. With a change to the bag material we were able
                      to use a smaller round hole for removal. At the end of the
                      curing process the hole is then used as the valve hole,
                      thus eliminating any excess loss of material or inherent
                      weakness.

                    <p>
                      If a rim is not uniform it’s inevitable that there will be
                      weak points that result. With our modern layup schedule,
                      removal of the pre-cured carbon ring and change in the air
                      bag removal, the resulting rim is a huge step forward in
                      strength and uniformity.

                      The air bladders are made from a special material which
                      produces smoother walls, result in a lighter rim, and are
                      completely removed without harsh chemicals. They are
                      removed through the valve hole with a unique process so
                      that the rim does not have to be patched like traditional
                      manufacturers use which improves the strength of the rims.
